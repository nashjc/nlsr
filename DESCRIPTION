Description: Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems.
      For the estimation of models reliable and robust tools than nls(), where the
      the Gauss-Newton method frequently stops with 'singular gradient' messages. 
      This is accomplished by using, where possible, analytic derivatives to compute
      the matrix of derivatives and a stabilization of the solution of the estimation
      equations. Tools for approximate or externally supplied derivative matrices
      are included. Bounds and masks on parameters are handled properly.
